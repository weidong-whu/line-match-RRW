# line-match-RRW
This is the implementation of our line segment matching algorithm and it is workable on Matlab 2016a.  
* The foler "Sec**" contains the stereo images and the matching results. 
* "showours.m" enables displaying the performance of our algorithm, and you can run "showothers.m" to display the performances of the other three algorithms.
* "test.m" enables testing the image pair with the fundament amtrix. 
* "test_schmid_image" enables  testing the Schimid's dataset in Sec7.3,or other image pairs with the camera projection matrixs.
* We have not put the images and ground truth in Sec7.2, because they were provided by Ali Ozgun Ok (ozguneo@gmail.com) and were not publicly released.
* The wrong labels for Sec7.1 and Sec7.4 can be found at "wronglines and graph.xlsx".
